# Markowitz Portfolio Optimization

This project implements the **Markowitz Mean-Variance Portfolio Theory**, which is a fundamental model in modern portfolio optimization.  
It helps investors construct an optimal portfolio by balancing **expected return** against **risk (variance/standard deviation)**.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `data/` – Input datasets (e.g., stock returns, asset prices).
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter/Colab notebooks for experimentation.
- `src/` – Core implementation files (optimization, visualization, utility functions).
- `results/` – Generated plots, efficient frontiers, and outputs.
- `README.md` – Project documentation.

## ⚙️ Features
- Calculate **expected returns** and **covariance matrix** from financial data.
- Construct the **efficient frontier**.
- Find the **global minimum variance portfolio** with optimla sharpe.
- Visualize results with clear plots.
